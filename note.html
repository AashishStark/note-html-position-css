		<div class="desc"><span id ="fi"><b>Doraemon</b></span> is written and illustrated by <span id ="fi"><b>Fujiko F. Fujio</b></span>, the pen name of Japanese manga artist Hiroshi.According to Fujio, it was originally conceived following a series of three events: when<br> searching for ideas for a new manga, he wished a machine existed that would come up with ideas for him, he tripped over his daughter's toy, and heard cats fighting in his neighborhood.<br>Doraemon is mainly aimed at children, so Fujio chose to create the character with a simple graphic style, based on shapes such as <span id ="fi"><b>circles and ellipses.</b></span> He used the same sequences of cartoons with<br> regularity and continuity to enhance the reader's ease of understanding. In addition, blue, a characteristic color of Doraemon.<br><br>During Doraemon's development, Fujio did not express a change in characters; he said, "When a manga hero become a success, the manga suddenly stops being interesting. So the hero has to be<br> like the stripes on a barber pole; he seems to keep moving upward, but actually he stays in the same place.<span id ="fi">"According to Zensho Ito, Fujio's former student</span>, the "length" of time in the universe is one of the ideas that inspired Fujio to make Doraemon.Frequently occur in its stories is Nobita's desire to control time, and there exist time-control gadgets that he uses to satisfy that desire, particularly the "Time Machine", which lies in his desk drawer. Unlike Western works on science fiction, the manga did not explain the theory nor the applied technology behind these tools, but instead focusing on how the characters exploit their advantages, making it more children-friendly.
